## Open questions
-   How are we defining the difference between harmful and allowable motion?
-   Is "5 seconds" the right number? What research do we have for this? What additional considerations might need to be included? Is it possible to see if one of our member organizations might be able to run research to learn more?
-   Should we categorize motion as immediately physiologically harmful, cumulatively harmful, functional use impeded?
