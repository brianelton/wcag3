## Functional Needs

* Use with sensitivity to motion (and pseudo-motion/photosensitivity)
* Use with limited orientation or spatial tracking
* Use with limited planning, orientation, or sequencing ability
* Use with limited ability to maintain, shift, and/or direct focus/attention
* Complete without unnecessary visual fatigue or sensory overwhelm
* Use with confidence that motion personalization will be respected

## User Stories
1\. As a user who might experience harm from motion, I need
1.  a "safe place" to be able to quickly escape the effects of motion or pseudo-motion when they occur (e.g., a quick key, shortcut, macro, button, pause/stop/hide, etc.); 
2.  a warning that I may be about to encounter a trigger, and to be provided with an alternative path so that I can still complete the task;
3.  my personalized settings at the device and user-agent level,  such as "reduce-motion," to be respected.
   
2\. As an individual who experiences sensory overload and/or visual processing difficulties, I need
1.  to be able to remove the motion and stress of a visual countdown timer;
2.  to be able to reduce the effects of motion when needed (but have the option to use them when helpful or enjoyable) so that I can complete a flow, and help returning to a flow so that I can complete it when the effects of motion interrupt me;
3.  to be able to reduce the visual perception of objects moving when browsing content, such as scrolling the page (one user refers to this experience as feeling like their "stomach falls out").
