*   Some errors do not require user intervention and correction of error. Users should not be interrupted for repetitive levels that don't require user action, such as a quick network connection drop. See the examples from [What to do with repetitive errors of low severity?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jtZaUzLi-jgmGdAypRUeJPzVz_ZUpMO0wdOrORiuO7w/edit#heading=h.8sxd4rwnfmg2)

*   If the system cannot move forward without user intervention, they should be notified.

*   If the system fails even if the user can’t fix it. If the app can’t do something, the user needs to be notified that something has gone wrong. If they can fix it, the user should be told how, and if they can’t, they should be told whatever is appropriate, even “try again in 30 minutes”
