Can the user discern or detect the error notification?

*   Should not be off-screen or be a sound-only.

*   Is the notification semantic and meets other sections of WCAG3?

*   The notification should be consistent relative to the view, process or trigger so it is easier for a user to identify the source of the error and locate what location, window, or tab is producing the error.
