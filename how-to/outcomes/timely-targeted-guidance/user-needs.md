## Barriers Encountered

*   Error source is not visually identified
*   Error source is not programmatically identified
*   Error source is not programmatically associated with error message
*   Error source is not accessible to assistive technology
*   Error source indicator is not identifiable (e.g., not recognizable as an error source indicator)
*   Error source indicator is not legible (e.g., not distinguishable)
*   Error notification does not occur at time of error
*   Time-limited error notification limits access to instructions
*   Error source visual label is not the same as its programmatic label, making it difficult to move focus using speech
*   Error message doesnâ€™t match source: Error message provides a different, ambiguous, or incomplete field label than the searchable visual label, making it difficult to search for the term in the form.

## Common User Needs

*   Visual error source indicator: User needs a visual indicator of the error source so they know which component is the source of the error.
*   Error message provided when error occurs: User needs an error message that is provided when the error occurs so they can readily refocus on the source of the error.
*   Error message persists: User needs an error message that persists until the error is remedied so they can access the remedy instructions for as long as it takes to address the error.
*   Error message linked to error source: User needs an error message that is linked to the error source so they can readily move focus to invalid inputs to correct them.
*   Error message focused on reload: User needs an error message that is focused when the page reloads so they know there was an error

## Unique User Needs

*   High-contrast error source indicator: User needs a prominent high-contrast error source indicator so they can identify the error source.
