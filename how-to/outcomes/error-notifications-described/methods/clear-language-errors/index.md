*   Discussion of how to handle a situation where there is only one Method. We agreed that if there are multiple methods, we can articulate which combinations of methods are satisfactory to meet the outcome, or it can be one outcome, one method.

*   When creating outcomes, there is an ongoing question about when to break apart outcomes and when to combine related requirements. The advantage of breaking outcomes apart is that separate outcomes raise awareness of needs and ensure critical parts are not hidden at lower levels of documentation. The disadvantage of creating separate outcomes is the sheer number of resulting outcomes which may feel overwhelming. Groups should remain aware of this tension and document the rationale for breaking outcomes apart. Conversely, combining outcomes as “outcome A and outcome B” may result in outcome B being overlooked
